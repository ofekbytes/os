“Apache CouchDB” team

Stable releases of http://couchdb.apache.org/ 
maintained and provided by the CouchDB project and community, 
based on the officially released tarballs.

Installation should be straightforward, usual caveats around making backup
before upgrading precautions apply, noting that between CouchDB 1.0.1 and
1.5.0 there are a number of key changes, including the on-disk data format
used by the .couch files was upgraded. Although it *should* keep your dbs
intact and do the right thing for your local.ini files, always have a backup
- or two!

```shell
# install the ppa-finding tool

# add the ppa - there is a ppa:couchdb/dev as well if you are feeling lucky
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:couchdb/stable -y
